      I create digital solutions optimized for computers, comfortable for users and innovative for the world.

      Hi i'm JdM. I'm passionate about development.
      As a computer science student I use my skills in this field to innovate and create while contributing to a more free, open and secure internet.

      Far beyond the digital realm, I want to bring my motivation to the real world by sharing my ideas and my determination to improve the world.

      I would like to build a world of innovation. A more free world. A world where online privacy is not violated. A more prosperous world. A more sustainable world. But also a world of peace.

      A world that would benefit all of humanity.

      I believe that many people are aware of these issues. My goal is to imagine solutions.
