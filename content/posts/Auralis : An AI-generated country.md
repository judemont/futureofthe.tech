## Introduction 
AI-Generated‚ú®, AI-Propulsed‚ú®, AI-Powered‚ú®.... In 2025, almost all products offer (or require) the use of AI to perform X or Y task. Generative AI first began generating text, then images, and now it can even create videos... It seems like it can create anything. But can it create a nation with everything that goes with it?

What would be the perfect country for you? If you could create an island nation anywhere you wanted, with your own flag, laws, and culture, what would it be like?

We all have a vision of a perfect society based on our values, but it's hard to turn that vision into a concrete project. That's why we're going to ask an artificial intelligence (LLM) to do it for us. If we haven‚Äôt managed to create the perfect nation, maybe an AI will succeed.

For this project, I will use Mistral's AI [‚ÄúLe Chat‚Äù](https://chat.mistral.ai).

## Marisola

First, our hypothetical nation needs a name.

### A name

Out of more than 190 countries, all different, all have a name. So for once, let's be normal.

![Image](../../images/28.png)  

**"Marisola"**.. Ok. Why not..

### A flag

For our flag, I will ask him to use the SVG format.

![Image](../../images/29.png)  

Ok, we have the SVG of our flag. But we‚Äôre not SVG nerds, so let‚Äôs open it as an image. 

And........

ü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Å

Here is the flag of our new country :

![Image](../../images/30.svg)  

Honestly, I really like it.

And as a bonus, we even have the meaning of our flag:

>- A blue background representing the surrounding ocean.
>- A golden sun in the center symbolizing a bright future and warm climate.
>- White waves at the bottom to represent the sea.
>- A white star above the sun to symbolize hope and guidance.

### A motto

![Image](../../images/42.png)  

> "Unity in Diversity, Strength in the Sea"

It's not that bad...

### A geographical location

If we want to move to *Marisola*, we need to determine the position and shape of the country.

![Image](../../images/31.png)

Okay, great, we have a position, now we can...

Wait...

We have a problem...

![Image](../../images/32.png)


Auralis must be an island, but the coordinates that the AI gave me point to Australia. We are not going to build our island on Australia.

First inattention mistake from the LLM, I'll remind him that Auralis must be an island.

![Image](../../images/33.png)

![Image](../../images/34.png)

Well... At least it's in the water. But there's still a problem. It's in Australian territorial waters, which could cause diplomatic issues.

![Image](../../images/35.png)

![Image](../../images/36.png)

We finally have the appropriate GPS coordinates. Marisola will be located in the South Pacific Ocean, in the Coral Sea.

We have a position. But we need a surface with a shape.

I asked the chat to use the KML format; this format allows representing GPS data and can be imported in google maps.

![Image](../../images/37.png)

Here's our island :

![Image](../../images/38.png)

It's not very big, so I'll zoom in a bit.

![Image](../../images/39.png)

Our island covers an area of 113 km2. This makes us the sixth smallest independent country in the world, between Liechtenstein and San Marino[¬π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area).

### A population

With an average temperature of 23.2¬∞C[¬≤](https://www.weather-average.com/) and a beautiful flag, does our island attract many inhabitants ? We will ask our founder.

![Image](../../images/40.png)

... ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶

It seems that our dear AI has forgotten the concept.

![Image](../../images/41.png)

Okay, so there are 48,321 inhabitants.

This makes us the twelfth country the least populated between Saint Kitts and Nevis and Dominica[¬≥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_(United_Nations)).

With an area of 113 km2 and a population of 48,321 inhabitants, this means that we have a population density of

> 48,321 / 113 = ~427.62 Inhabitants/km2

It's exactly (~~) the same as Haiti. This means that it is the 32nd most densely populated country[‚Å¥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density).

### A Constitution 

Okay, so we have a flag, a motto, an island near Australia, and 48,321 inhabitants. But for now, we're not really a country, we're just random guys on our island in total anarchy (For better or for worse). 

To make us a united country, we need a constitution that will contain all the fundamental principles and rights, as well as the political organization.

Developing a constitution from scratch is very complicated and can take humans several years. Let's see what AI can create. 

![Image](../../images/43.png)

This constitution will be the foundation of our nation. I made [a PDF file](https://futureofthe.tech/pdf/Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_Marisola.pdf) out of it, it's less than three pages long. By way of comparison, the Swiss constitution is approximately 96 pages long[‚Åµ](https://www.ivs.admin.ch/images/bundesinventar_FR/101.pdf) (and the constitution of india ~803 pages[‚Å∂](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-country-has-the-longest-written-constitution-in-the-world.html) [‚Å∑](https://lddashboard.legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/coi/COI_2024.pdf)). But quantity does not equal quality, so we will keep this constitution (in any case, it's not up to us to decide here...). 

*I swear to uphold the Constitution.* ([And therefore also not to modify it secretly on my website......](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/key-sections-of-the-us-constitution-deleted-from-governments-website/))


### Money

We have a political system, beautiful beaches, and a happy life on our island. What more could we need?

![Image](../../images/44.png)
![Image](../../images/44.png)

![Image](../../images/44.png)

ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë

Okayyy, let's create banknotes. I'll ask for a design. But first, I need to make it completely clear, even if it‚Äôs off-topic, that I am a staunch Bitcoin maximalist (; .

![Image](../../images/45.png)

![Image](../../images/46.jpg)

At first glance, these banknotes don't look too bad. When you look closer, there are some errors in the writing, but that's not my problem. If the IA wants these banknotes, we'll accept them.

### ID card

When I told my friends that I was a Marisola citizen, for some reason, they didn‚Äôt believe me, and I had no proof. That‚Äôs why we need an ID card.

I'll ask the AI to create a design in SVG so that I can modify it and offer you ID cards.

![Image](../../images/47.png)

Here's mine ü•∞ :

![Image](../../images/48.svg)

### A Website

Let's imagine that you want official information about Marisola. You're not going to travel halfway around the world (unless you're Australian) to get it, nor are you going to read a book on the subject (you're a modern person). No, we need an official website for the government of the Republic of Marisola!

![Image](../../images/49.png)


We have the code!

Let's see what it looks like.

I copy paste the HTML into a HTML file .... I make a few adjustments and....

Here is the official website of Marisola :

[futureofthe.tech/marisola](https://futureofthe.tech/marisola)
 
(I'll add features in the future)

### International recognition

Okay, I think we have everything we need. Thank you for listening to me, and see you soon! Now I'll have time to create an account on this revolutionary new artificial intelligence...

Wait...

**We have a problem...**

![Image](../../images/50.png)


Where is Marisola on the list ? Where is my one and only country üòü ??

The problem is that no one knows my country and no one recognizes it as a country. 

A good way to gain international recognition is to join the United Nations. There are already 293 members, so I don't see why they wouldn't accept Marisola.

It's simple, my AI will send them an email asking them to include us.

![Image](../../images/51.png)

Here's the complete email :

> **Subject:** Formal Request for Membership in the United Nations

Well... They still haven't responded... I'll keep you informed... In the meantime, we also need to send an email to Unicode asking them to create a new emoji : the flag of our beloved country.






## Conclusion

Do we have a country now ? 
- No.

Firstly, because all of this is hypothetical, if you go to Marisola's GPS coordinates, you will only find water (which is actually pretty cool).

But above all, a country cannot be summed up by a name, a flag, a territory, a currency, or even a constitution. A nation is much more than what AI can do.

As the anarchist saying goes, 
> the only good nation is imagination.

Personally, I would rather say that
> the only *perfect* nation is imagination.

However, *imagination* is precisely what AI cannot do.

Our AI did nothing original or innovative. Nothing very interesting, in fact. 

So what was the point of this article? The goal was not to conduct a rigorous study on AI and the creation of countries, nor to show why AI is good or bad (that means nothing to an AI). My goal was simply to conduct an experiment that I found amusing.

**Unity in Diversity, Strength in the Sea**
