I apologize in advance to all the fans of JetBrains products, Sublime Text, Zed, and even VIM (if you're using Notepad++, I have no excuse to offer you >;). I have tested each of these software tools (I still haven't managed to quit VIM, please help me!), and I believe I can confidently say that, in my opinion, Visual Studio Code is the best code editor. 

It's the best because it's full of useful features, is pleasant to use and has a wide range of extensions. 

Of course this is a personal opinion, and I can understand that you would prefer another IDE. But anyway, that's not the point. The aim of this article is not to explain why VScode is good, but rather to explain how it could be.

Visual Studio Code was created by __Microsoft__ in 2015. 

This seems like a paradox to me.

The big question is, 
```
*How could Microsoft create something truly great?*
```
How is it possible ?

Microsoft is best known for creating Windows, but also many other software products. What connects all these software tools in my eyes is that they are all horrible to use.

Except Visual Studio Code. 
> And I specifically mean Visual Studio CODE, because Visual Studio is horrible to use too.

To return to the original question, how could Microsoft create a good software when they usually only create bad ones ?

Today, I will give you a definitive answer to this question:

**probabilities**

Even something highly improbable has a small chance of happening if it is repeated often enough.

A monkey doesn't have the capacity to write a dissertation on human existence (or an article about VSCode). However, if you put many monkeys in front of typewriters and let them type random letters, given enough time, it is certain that they will eventually succeed.

It's exactly the same for Microsoft. I'm not saying that Microsoft employees are monkeys (Unless we consider the fact that humans are a type of monkey) but they're obviously not very experienced at creating a good user experience. But that doesn't mean they can't do it, just that they're unlikely to do it by chance.But the likelihood of them succeeding increases each time they try.

As it happens, Microsoft has created a vast number of software products. According to this Wikipedia list, they have created around 400 different software. So, even if they have no talent, it's quite logical that they eventually created a good thing. 

On average, they manage to create 1 good thing out of 400 bad things. Like a monkey that eventually types a correct sentence by randomly hitting keys.

I'm not a Microsoft hater; it's just an observation based on my subjective experiences.
