<p id="introduction">
    I started web development at a very young age, and creating a personal website has always been a rewarding activity.
    Before arriving at this version, I regularly created multiple iterations of my site, each with a different
    interface. At first, I was afraid of CSS, so I started by building simple sites with just text and images. Today,
    I've returned to that simplicity—but for different reasons. I've archived some of my site versions since 2023, which
    I'd like to show you.
</p>
<h2 id="my-site-that-you-should-talk-to">My site that you should talk to</h2> <img src="images/1.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v1">futureofthe.tech/history/v1</a></i></p> <br>
<p> In 2023 (I was 14), I created a site with the goal of rethinking user interfaces in a completely different way. On
    this site, you can talk to a script that answers you in a way that's somewhat similar to how I would. It's not an
    AI, but a list of questions and answers. When you ask something, the script finds the most similar question in its
    list and responds accordingly—sometimes with a bit of humor. </p> <img src="images/2.png" alt="">
<p> It wasn't really a good interface, as the information wasn't easy to find, and often my script didn’t have an
    answer. <br> But I still find the idea very interesting. The goal of the site wasn’t to directly display content to
    the visitor, but to let them ask the robot for what they wanted. <br> In a way, the concept was a bit visionary.
    With the rise of language models, it’s now common to see conversational agents we can interact with on websites.
</p> <img src="images/3.png" style="max-width: 200px !important;" alt="">
<p> These chatbots often use the OpenAI API, with an initial prompt that includes the page content and other site
    information. <br> For now, these chatbots are just another feature of traditional websites. But who knows? Maybe in
    the near future, websites will stop presenting content directly. Instead, we’ll ask the chatbot questions to find
    what we’re looking for. <br><br> <b>We won't be visiting sites—we’ll be <i>talking to them</i>.</b> </p>
<h2 id="my-site-with-no-purpose">My site with no purpose</h2>
<p> In 2023, I created the strangest version of my personal website. It displayed my logo with social links and cycled
    through random programming jokes or sentences every few seconds. <br> What’s strange is that when you scroll,
    there’s no new content. Instead, a spinning tourbillon appears in the background, a screaming audio track plays, and
    the page stretches for endless scrolling. </p> <img src="images/4.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v2">futureofthe.tech/history/v2</a></i></p> <br>
<p> You might ask what the purpose of this strange idea was. I could say it was an artistic project, or that it was fun.
    <br> But no. It was none of that. I built the site simply because I had nothing else to do. I had just started
    learning web development and was amazed by the infinite creative possibilities. I didn’t make the site for money, or
    for school, or even to share anything with the world. <br><br> For me, the purpose of a website wasn’t to display
    content with a polished design and specific goal. <br> <b>For me, a site was just a way to experiment, explore, and
        learn.</b>
</p>
<h2 id="a-more-professional-website">A more professional website</h2>
<p> By the end of 2023, I had improved a lot in web development and wanted to use my new skills to improve my site. So I
    made a new version. Compared to the previous ones, this one was much better. It wasn’t just an experiment—it was a
    real presentation website with content and an organized design. </p> <img src="images/5.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v3">futureofthe.tech/history/v3</a></i></p>
<p> This version was simple but pretty. </p> <br>
<h2 id="my-websites-that-wanted-to-be-more">My websites that wanted to be more than just websites</h2>
<p> In 2024 and 2025, I created several versions of my site. I wanted them to be more impressive, with more animated
    elements. I wanted to wow visitors with beauty and interactivity. </p> <img src="images/6.png" alt=""
    style="max-width: 400px !important;"> <img src="images/7.png" alt="" style="max-width: 400px !important;"> <img
    src="images/8.png" alt="" style="max-width: 400px !important;">
<p> <i><a href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v4">futureofthe.tech/history/v4</a></i> <br> <i><a
            href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v5">futureofthe.tech/history/v5</a></i> <br> <i><a
            href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v6">futureofthe.tech/history/v6</a></i> </p> <br>
<p> The goal of those sites wasn’t just to display content but to offer a visual experience. In my mind, the result was
    incredible. But I forgot something: I’m not a web designer, and good design is hard. So these sites weren’t that
    great. <br><br> My determination to make something impressive made the site less readable, less organized, and
    ultimately—not that good. </p>
<h2 id="my-site-that-wasnt-mine">My site that wasn’t mine</h2>
<p> In 2025, I accepted the truth: I’m not a good web designer. And honestly, I don’t enjoy it. But I still wanted a
    good-looking site, and I had a solution: I created the HTML content and asked the AI "Claude" to generate the CSS
    design. </p> <img src="images/12.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://futureofthe.tech/history/v8">futureofthe.tech/history/v8</a></i></p>
<p> The result looked good, the design was pretty. But... there were two problems. First, I didn’t like it: yes, it was
    pretty, but it wasn’t my site. I hadn’t made it—it didn’t reflect me. <br> Second, after visiting several
    AI-generated websites, I noticed how similar they all looked. AIs are good at creating design, but they lack one key
    quality of a designer: creativity. If websites are all designed by AIs in the future, there will be no originality.
    That would be a shame. </p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-a-website">What is the purpose of a website?</h2>
<p> In January 1991, the first public web servers were turned on. On August 6, 1991, Tim Berners-Lee published a short
    summary of the World Wide Web project. Let’s take a look at the page. </p> <img src="images/9.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a></i>
</p>
<p> The page is just black text on a white background with blue links. It’s not pretty or impressive. But was that the
    goal? Was Berners-Lee trying to build an impressive page full of animations and interactive elements? </p>

<br><br>
<p> No, it wasn’t. For one, CSS didn’t exist. But more importantly, that wasn’t the point. The sole purpose of that page
    was to introduce the World Wide Web. And it succeeded. It’s organized, readable, and the whole site weighs only 2.17
    KB. <br><br> Would it really be better if the site had a modern design? <br> I asked <a
        href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a> to generate a modern CSS design for the page. Here’s the result: </p> <img
    src="images/10.png" alt="">
<p><i><a
            href="https://claude.site/artifacts/2d805b4b-9e50-42b2-8b0e-c0c12fedfd0b">claude.site/artifacts/2d805b4b-9e50-42b2-8b0e-c0c12fedfd0b</a></i>
</p>
<p> Yeah! The design is much better! <br><br> But now the page weighs 57 KB. And... sure, it’s prettier. But the
    information isn’t any easier to find, and the structure isn’t improved. <br><br> The original page gets straight to
    the point. With the modern AI design, the page looks good—but doesn’t help you understand the content better.
    <br><br> Before I was born, the purpose of a website was to share information. <b>But what about now?</b>
</p>

<br><br>
<p> On October 24, 2000, Google launched Google Ads, allowing companies to pay for digital ads and web creators to earn
    money through ad integration. That day, Google changed the Internet forever. </p>

<br><br>
<p> According to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/advertising">estimates</a>, over half of all
    websites display ads. That’s a lot. It’s also why the purpose of websites has changed. Their main goal is no longer
    to share ideas—it’s to attract attention. <br> The Internet runs on the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economy</a>, and that’s a problem. <br>
    Websites with ads don’t aim to share quality content. They just want your clicks. <br> There’s a big difference
    between content that’s attractive and content that’s meaningful. <br><br> Information doesn’t need to be true to
    grab your attention. A site with 1,000 AI-generated, exaggerated articles will be more profitable than one with
    verified facts. <br><br> That’s why you can’t trust services that earn money through ads or personal data. </p>
<p> Maybe this is what the first page of the web would look like if it were created in 2025: </p> <img
    src="images/11.png" alt="">

<h2 id="why-my-website-isnt-beautiful">Why my website isn't beautiful, and why I don't care</h2>
<p> This site isn’t pretty or impressive. There’s no elaborate design or animations. It’s just white text on a black
    background. By modern standards, this isn’t attractive. <br> But when I created it, I thought about its purpose—its
    reason to exist online. And here’s my conclusion: I created this site to share ideas, information, and my view of
    the world. Not to impress people with design. <br><br> <b>Keeping the design simple is the best way to focus on what
        matters: the content and purpose.</b> </p>
<h2 id="design-not-credibility">Design <b>≠</b> Credibility</h2>
<p> Very often, the flashiest sites have little substance and no clear purpose. Some of the most beautiful sites I’ve
    seen are from blockchain or AI projects. But that doesn’t mean they’re credible—often, they’re not. <br><br> Take
    the most serious blockchain project: Bitcoin. Its "official" website is <a
        href="https://bitcoin.org">bitcoin.org</a>. </p> <img src="images/13.png" alt="">
<p> The design is basic, but the content is readable and right there on the homepage. <br><br> Now compare that to a
    less serious blockchain project. Here’s the archived site for Terra, a blockchain protocol that suddenly collapsed
    in 2022: </p> <img src="images/14.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240307093841/https://terra.money/">terra.money (archive.org)</a></i></p>
<br>
<p> I encourage you to visit the archive. The design is stunning. <br> But flashy design is often used to hide the lack
    of real content. <br> Think about the most content-rich site on the Internet: Wikipedia. It’s literally just black
    text on a white background. </p> <img src="images/15.png" alt="">
<p> Wikipedia wouldn’t be better with flashy design. Because content is what really matters. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p> We've explored many ways to present a website. No one knows what tomorrow’s sites design will be. But one thing’s
    clear: I’ve found what suits me. <br> A simple design is ultimately the best way for me to share my ideas. <br> And
    <b>since you're reading this now, it's a success.</b>
