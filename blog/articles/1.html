<h1>How web changed for me, and for the world</h1>

<br><br>
<p>
    I started web development at a very young age and creating a presentation site for myself has always been a very
    good activity. Before arriving at this site I very regularly created several versions of my site, always with a
    different interface. At first I was afraid of css, so I started by making simple sites with text and images. Today
    I'm back to that simplicity, but for other reasons. I've archived some of my site versions since 2023, which I'd
    like to show you.
</p>
<h2>My site that you should talk to</h2>

<br>
<p>In 2023 (I was 14) I made a site. The goal was to completely rethink user interfaces with a completely
    different approach. On this site, you can talk to a script who will answer you in somewhat the same way as I would.
    It's not an AI, but a list of questions and answers. When you ask a question, the AI looks for the most similar
    question in its list and answers it as indicated with sometimes a bit of humore.
    <br>
</p>

<p>It's not really a good interface because the information isn't easy to find, and often my script didn't have an
    answer to the question. <br>
    But I still find the idea very interesting. The site's idea is not to display content
    directly to the visitor, but to let him ask the robot for what he want. <br>
    In a way, the concept was a bit visionary. With the development of language models, it's not uncommon to see
    conversational agents, with whom we can ask questions on the site.

<p>
    These chatbots often use the openai API, with a first prompt containing the page content and other information about
    the site.
    <br>
    For now, these chatbots are just another feature of the original site. But who knows, maybe in the near future
    websites will no longer present content directly. We'll ask the chatbot questions to find the information
    we're looking for.
    <br><br>
    <b>We won't be visiting sites, we'll be <i>talking to them</i>.</b>
</p>
<h2>My site with no purpose</h2>
<p>
    In 2023 I made the strangest version of my personal website. The site displays my logo with social links and every
    few seconds presents a new random sentence or joke about programming.
    <br>
    What's strange is that when the visitor scrolls, there's no new content. Instead, a tourbiollon spins in the
    background, a screaming audio track plays and the page expands to allow endless scrolling.

<br>
<p>
    You might ask what the purpose of this strange idea is. I could answer that it's because it's an artistic project or
    because it's soo fun.
    <br>
    But no. It's not any of that. If I spent time creating this site, it's simply because I had nothing else to do. I'd
    just started doing web development and I was very impressed by the infinite creation possibilities. I didn't make a
    site for money, or for school, or even to share anything to the world.
    <br><br>
    For me, the purpose of a site wasn't to display content
    with an elaborate design and a specific objective. <br>
    <b>For me a site was just to try, explore and learn.</b>
</p>
<h2>A more profesional website</h2>
<p>
    In the end 2023 I had improved a lot in web dev and I wanted to improve my site with my new skills. So I made a new
    version of my site. Compared to the previous version this one was much better. It wasn't just a try to learn, it was
    a real presentation website with content and organised design.

<p>
    This version was simple, but pretty.
</p>
<br>
<h2>My websites that wanted to be more than just a website</h2>
<p>
    In 2024 and 2025 I made several versions of my site. I wanted to make always more impressive sites with always more
    animated elements. I wanted to impress the visitor with a site that was as beautiful as possible.

</p>
<br>
<p>
    The goal of those sites wasn't just to display content but to but to be a visual experience. In my head, the result
    was incredible, but I forgot something: I'm not a web designer, and good design isn't easy. So these sites weren't
    that good.
    <br><br>
    This determination to make my site impressive only made it less readable, less organized and finally not
    so good.
</p>
<h2>My actual site : A content-oriented site</h2>
<p>
    This site is neither pretty, nor impressive. There's no elaborate design. There's no animations. There's just text.
    White text on a black background. In short, by our standards, this site isn't pretty. <br>
    When I created this site, I thought about its purpose, its reason for being shared on the Internet.
</p>

<h2>What is the purpose of a WebSite ?</h2>
<p>
    In January 1991 the first public web servers were turned on. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary
    of
    the World Wide Web project. Let's take a look at the page.
</p>
<img src="images/9.png" alt="">
<p><i><a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a></i>
</p>
<p>
    The page is just black text on a white background with blue links. It's neither pretty, nor impressive, but was it
    the
    goal ? Was it the goal of Berners-Lee to create an impressive web page with a lot of animation and interactives
    elements
    ?
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
    No, it was not. Firstly it wasn't possible because CSS didn't exist, but above all, that wasn't the purpose of this
    page. The one and only purpose of this page was to introduce the World Wide Web. And the mission has been
    successfully
    accomplished: the site is separated by multiple pages and is totally readable and understandable. On top of that,
    the
    site only weighs 2.17 KB. <br><br>
    Would it be really better if the website haved a complete moderne design ?<br>
    I asked <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a> to generated a moderne css design for this page. <br>
    Here is the result.
</p>

            href="https://claude.site/artifacts/2d805b4b-9e50-42b2-8b0e-c0c12fedfd0b">claude.site/artifacts/2d805b4b-9e50-42b2-8b0e-c0c12fedfd0b</a></i>
</p>
<p>
    Yeah ðŸ˜Ž ! The design is much better !
    <br><br>
    But the page now weighs 57 KB. And... Okay... it's prettier, but the information isn't any easier to find, and the
    content isn't any better structured. <br><br>
    On the first page, you can, in a second, understand the purpose of the site and find what you're looking for. With
    the
    modern AI-generated design the page is beautiful, but it's no easier to find the content you're looking for.
    <br><br>
    Before I was born the purpose of a site was to share informations to other persons. <b>But what's now ?</b>
</p>
<br><br>

<p>
    On October 24, 2000, Google released Google Ads. Google Ads is a digital advertising service. Companies can pay
    Businesses can pay Google to create ads, and web creators can integrate Google Ads into their websites to earn
    money. On that day, Google changed the face of the Internet for the eternity.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
    According to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/advertising">estimates</a>, more than half of all
    websites have ads on them. It's a lot. And that's why the purpose of websites has radically evolved. The main goal
    is no longer to share content but to attract as many visitors as possible. The Internet is mainly driven by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economy</a> and that's a problem. <br>
    Websites with ads don't try to make good content, they don't try to share ideas, all they want is your attention.
    There's a big difference between attractive content and interesting content.
    The information doesn't have to be true or relevant to get your attention. A site with 1,000 news articles with
    exagerated content will attract more of your attention and therefore be more profitable.
    <br>
    That's why you can't trust
    services whose source of income is advertising or the sale of personal data.
    <br><br>
    Maybe this is what the first page of the world wide web would look like if it were created in 2025 :
