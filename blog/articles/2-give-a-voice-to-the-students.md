## Introduction
This article tells the story of a group of students who, a few years ago, launched a website that turned my school upside down in just a few days. It’s the story of how my friends and I used our coding skills to make our vision a reality — how the entire school caught wind of it, and how the education authority responded. It's a story of surprises, mistakes, pressure and lies, but above all it's the initiative of a student who hadn't planned any of it.

## How did it all begin ?
All this begun a few years ago when I was 15. I was already working on web development projects with friends from time to time, just to pass the time and because it was fun. One day we had an idea for an ambitious and exciting project without having any idea of how far it was going to go.

## What was the problem ?
> This section differs from the rest of the article, as it includes not only factual information but also my personal vision and interpretation of the situation. Naturally, __my opinion is solely my own__.

To create this site, we started from a simple observation: some teachers are sometimes totally or partially incompetent in their work and very few measures are taken. The real problem is that teachers are poorly supervised, and students are practically powerless to do anything about it. 

Unlike most services, teaching isn’t directly controlled or chosen by the customer — and that’s a major problem.

Imagine two people each opening a bakery in a village. One of them is passionate about her work and puts a lot of time into making great bread. The other lacks motivation and, unfortunately, the skills to make good bread.

Thankfully, both bakers won’t meet the same success because customers can choose which bakery to go to. Services like Google Maps make that decision even easier by offering ratings and reviews.

On the other hand, teaching works very differently. Some teachers are very unskilled and sometimes behave very inappropriately. Others are much more competent and pleasant for the students. But both will continue to teach, while sometimes degrading the quality of teaching and the well-being of the students. 

The problem is that students don't have the opportunity to speak out and denounce inappropriate attitudes.

__So we built what is essentially Google Maps for teachers — a place where students could rate and comment teachers, just like with businesses.__

## Our solution: a website where students can rate and review their teachers
